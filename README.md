# Generalised_Synthetic_DID

So the standard SDID method ([Athey et al](https://file-lianxh.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Refs/Paper2022/Arkhangelsky-2021-Synthetic-Difference-In-Differences.pdf)) is a method of causal inference conducted by re-weighting control unit and pre-intervention time points to estimate what an outcome would have been without an intervention under non-random allocation to treatment. That method selects unit and time weights by selecting weights which minimise the sum of squared residuals against the comparison outcome. In the gaussian case, minimising the sum of squared residuals is equivalent to maximising the likelihood, so in that sense standard SDID can be interpreted as simply maximising the likelihood under certain assumptions about the outcome. Typically the outcomes we analyse are in fact not normally distributed and are nearly always counts or rates. Counts and rates are sometimes well approximated by the normal distribution, but often they are not, especially when n is small or close to boundary conditions (eg a count near zero). 

An obvious extension therefore would be to re-create this method but by selecting weights in such a way that directly maximises the likelihood in a way appropriate for binomial or poisson distributions. This should make the method both more efficient and less biased in such cases. That is the core goal here.
